    "The digital anthropology is a resource related to the poetry published between 1870 to 1928. This has increased to around 4000 poems by January 2025. It is open open-access resource for anyone interested in African American poetry history, including students, teachers, and researchers. This collection contains poetry from African American magazines such as The Crisis, Opportunity, The Messenger, and Negro World. Apart from this, poetry from other sources, including books, periodicals, and solo-authored texts, is also collected. Poetry also has an important role both in social awareness and in past societal construction. The anthologies such as James Weldon Johnson's Book of American Negro Poetry, Alain Locke's The New Negro: an Interpretation, and Countee Cullen's Caroling Dusk played an important role in the Harlem  Renaissance."
